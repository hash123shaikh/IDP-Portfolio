This repository tracks my Individual Development Plans (IDPs) created as part of my professional development at the Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL), Christian Medical College Vellore.

## 📋 About

An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a strategic document that helps:
- **Assess** current skills, interests, and strengths
- **Set goals** and map milestones for research, papers, and grants
- **Communicate** evolving career goals with advisors
- **Identify** and develop targeted skills for success
- **Navigate** challenges and optimize research experience
